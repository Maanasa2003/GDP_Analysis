1. Executive Summary

This project analyzes the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) trends of selected countries over the past decade. 
The objective is to understand economic growth patterns, compare performance across nations, and identify factors
 influencing growth, such as inflation, investment, and trade balance. The analysis is performed using Python (.py scripts) 
 and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), with data collected from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

2. Introduction

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one of the most widely used indicators to measure the health of an economy.
It reflects the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time frame.
This project focuses on evaluating GDP trends, growth rates, and associated macroeconomic variables to better understand
the performance of various economies.

3. Objectives

  1.To collect and preprocess GDP and related economic indicators from the World Bank and IMF.
  2.To visualize GDP trends across countries over time.
  3.To analyze correlations between GDP and key variables such as inflation, investment, and trade balance.
  4.To generate insights on economic performance and future growth potential.

4. Methodology

Data Collection: Data obtained from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) and IMF DataMapper.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning missing values, normalizing formats, and ensuring consistency across indicators.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics and visualizations for GDP and related variables.
Visualization: Line plots, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps generated using Python libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, pandas).
Comparative Analysis: GDP growth rates compared across countries and regions.

5. Analysis and Results

5.1 GDP Trends
Countries like India and China showed consistent GDP growth over the last decade.
Developed economies such as the USA and Germany showed steady growth but at a slower pace.

5.2 Correlation Analysis
Strong positive correlation between GDP and investment rates.
Moderate negative correlation observed between GDP growth and inflation.
Trade balance exhibited varied effects depending on the country.

5.3 Key Insights
Emerging economies are growing faster than developed ones.
Inflation control plays a key role in sustaining GDP growth.
Investment drives long-term GDP expansion.

5.4 Generated Plots

The following plots were generated and saved in the reports/plots/ folder and also embedded within the Jupyter Notebook
 (GDP_Analysis.ipynb):
Line Graph – GDP growth trends (2010–2024) for selected countries.
Bar Chart – Comparison of average GDP growth rates by country.
Heatmap – Correlation between GDP, inflation, investment, and trade balance.

6. Discussion

The results confirm that investment and inflation management are crucial for sustainable growth.
Developing economies like India have a strong upward trajectory due to rising investments and domestic demand.
On the other hand, developed countries show maturity in growth, with smaller fluctuations but stable performance.
Trade balance remains an important factor that requires further detailed analysis.

7. Conclusion

This project successfully analyzed GDP and its influencing factors using open economic datasets.
The insights gained highlight the importance of investment and inflation in driving GDP growth.
The results can be used by policymakers, economists, and businesses to make informed decisions.
Future extensions of this project could include predictive modeling using machine learning techniques to forecast GDP trends.
